  <p>Nick Styles' DJ carrier started in 1998 in his native Bulgaria where he was playing a mixture of House, Techno, Trance, Big Beats and Drum 'N' Bass. The underground electronic music at that time is still young and the DJ's are playing many
    styles for the happy listeners. In 1999 a harder sound was introduced and Nick Styles was deeply inspired and followed the path - the path of Hard Percussive Minimal Techno. He started organizing parties in his city, inviting many of the
    underground DJ's from the scene. He was also touring around the country playing his style in other cities. In 2002 he was attracted to softer house sounds and this became his style - Disco, Soulful, French and Funky House. Always curious about
    music he started extensive research about the roots of House Music leading him to Jazz, Funk, Disco and Soul. In 2010 Nick Styles started fulfilling his long-time dream to produce music which revealed new opportunities in his eternal pursuit of
    giving joy and happiness to people.</p>
